# My-Front-End-Challenge
A one-week project using React & TypeScript to familiarize myself with the once foreign front-end layer.

## Dependencies and Requirements:
1. *Node.js* 10 or higher and *npm* 6 or higher installed.
2. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` from the project's directory.
3. Run the project by running `npm start`.


## Description:
This project mimics the site and server of a company's logistics center, by providing user with tools to search through customers' orders.   

## Functionality:

1. Utilizing the following filters the user can retrieve a narrowed result set out of the orders in the database (JSON file):
  * Search for the customer's name / order ID. 
  * Fulfillment status.
  * Product name.
  * Payment status.
2. A user can conveniently change the order's fulfillment status by clicking the designated button.  
3. Further details regarding an order can be displayed by simply clicking on said order.
4. A large result set will be spread upon multiple pages evenly, by using pagination. 
5. For a closer inspection, Hovering over a product's image will create a zoom-in effect on said product.
